Full Example Pipeline for Statistical Shape Modeling with ShapeWorks
====================================================================

In this example, we provide unpre-processed left atrial dataset,
which consists of the LGE scan and its segmentation across some number of subjects.
Since the data set is not pre-processed, it requires all re-processing steps;
resampling, padding, alignment, etc. To run the ShapeWorks particle-based optimization,
the processed segmentation files are converted to the signed distance transform.
This example is set to serve as a test case for users who want to process the raw(gray-sclae)
images as well as their binary segmentation images.

In this example, the raw and segmentation data are sharing the same functions for pre-processing,
such as the same transformation matrices for the center of mass and rigid alignment or same bounding box for cropping.
