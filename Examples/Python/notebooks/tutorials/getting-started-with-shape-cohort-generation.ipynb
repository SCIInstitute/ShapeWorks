    "   i. [Ellipsoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid) <br> \n",
    "   An ellipsoid is symmetrical about three mutually perpendicular axes that intersect at the center. If a, b, and c are the principal semiaxes, the general equation of such an ellipsoid is \n",
    "   $$\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ii. [Supershapes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-018-2034-z?shared-article-renderer) \n",
    "   \n",
    "    Supershapes are an extension of [superellipses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21659124/) that can exhibit variable symmetry as well as asymmetry and that    can describe through a single equation, the so-called superformula, a wide variety of shapes, including geometric primitives. The appeal of supershapes is their ability to express through a single equation a wide range of primitives and organic shapes. The superformula is given by : \n",
    "    $$r(\\theta) = [(|\\frac{1}{a}cos(\\frac{m\\theta}{4} |)^{n_2} + |\\frac{1}{b}sin(\\frac{m\\theta}{4} |)^{n_3} ]^{\\frac{-1}{n_1}}$$\n",
    "Unlike superellipses, supershapes need not be symmetric; the parameter $m$ controls the rotational symmetry. The values of  a and b control the size, and the exponents $n_1,n_2$ and $n_3$ control the curvature of the sides.The superformula can produce a wide range of shapes,including many shapes found in nature. \n",
    "The `ShapeCohortGenerator` package allows the user to specify the rotational symmetry $m$ and the size. The values of $n_1,n_2$ and $n_3$ are randomly selected to creates shapes with different curvature.\n",
    "To see examples of these supershapes run the cell bellow this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a shape cohort ?\n",
    "A shape cohort is a collection of shape generated by varying the different parameters of the shape.\n",
    "### Need for the `ShapeCohortGenerator`\n",
    "We require  a shape population dataset to  run the shape modeling  work flow. Each population dataset requires unique grooming steps. Developing and testing complicated grooming pipelines for heavy datasets can consume a lot of computational resources and time. Hence, having  a few toy datasets, which are lightweight and robust in variability can make this development and debugging process easier and simpler.These cohorts can also be used to test the optimization work flow. \n",
    "### Capabilities of  `ShapeCohortGenerator`\n",
    "The `ShapeCohortGenerator` package can be used to generate collection of ellipsoids  or supershapes, where the user can control the number of shapes in the cohort and the variability of the members of the cohort.\n",
    "Each cohort will have mesh data(vtk and ply formats) and segmentation image data(nrrd format).These cohorts generated by the package can be directly run with `ShapeWorks`. Generating these cohorts in the `Output` folder would be a good way to start.\n",
    "\n",
