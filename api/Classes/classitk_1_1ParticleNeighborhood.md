## Detailed Description

```cpp
template <unsigned int VDimension =3>
class itk::ParticleNeighborhood;
```


A [ParticleNeighborhood](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleNeighborhood.md) is responsible for computing neighborhoods of particles. Given a point position in a domain, and a neighborhood radius, the [ParticleNeighborhood](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleNeighborhood.md) returns a list of points that are neighbors of that point. The base class, [ParticleNeighborhood](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleNeighborhood.md), must be subclassed to provide functionality; the base class will throw an exception when FindNeighborhoodPoints is called.

```


Point type used to store particle locations. 


### typedef DomainType

```cpp
typedef ParticleDomain itk::ParticleNeighborhood< VDimension >::DomainType;
```


Domain type. The Domain object provides bounds and distance information. 


### typedef PointContainerType

```cpp
typedef ParticleContainer<PointType> itk::ParticleNeighborhood< VDimension >::PointContainerType;
```


Container type for points. This matches the itkParticleSystem container type. 


### typedef PointVectorType

```cpp
typedef std::vector<ParticlePointIndexPair<VDimension> > itk::ParticleNeighborhood< VDimension >::PointVectorType;
```


Point list (vector) type. This is the type of list returned by FindNeighborhoodPoints. 


## Public Functions Documentation

### function itkNewMacro

```cpp
itkNewMacro(
    Self 
)
```


Method for creation through the object factory. 


### function itkTypeMacro

```cpp
itkTypeMacro(
    ParticleNeighborhood ,
    DataObject 
)
```


Run-time type information (and related methods). 


### function itkStaticConstMacro

```cpp
itkStaticConstMacro(
    Dimension ,
    unsigned int ,
    VDimension 
)
```


Dimensionality of the domain of the particle system. 


### function itkSetObjectMacro

```cpp
itkSetObjectMacro(
    PointContainer ,
    PointContainerType 
)
```


Set/Get the point container. These are the points parsed by the Neighborhood class when FindNeighborhoodPoints is called. 


### function itkGetConstObjectMacro

```cpp
itkGetConstObjectMacro(
    PointContainer ,
    PointContainerType 
)
```


### function FindNeighborhoodPoints

```cpp
inline virtual PointVectorType FindNeighborhoodPoints(
    const PointType & ,
    int idx,
    double 
) const
```


**Reimplemented by**: [itk::ParticleRegionNeighborhood::FindNeighborhoodPoints](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleRegionNeighborhood.md#function-findneighborhoodpoints), [itk::ParticleRegionNeighborhood::FindNeighborhoodPoints](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleRegionNeighborhood.md#function-findneighborhoodpoints)


Compile a list of points that are within a specified radius of a given point. The default implementation will throw an exception. 


### function FindNeighborhoodPoints

```cpp
inline virtual PointVectorType FindNeighborhoodPoints(
    const PointType & ,
    int idx,
    std::vector< double > & ,
    double 
) const
```


**Reimplemented by**: [itk::ParticleSurfaceNeighborhood::FindNeighborhoodPoints](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleSurfaceNeighborhood.md#function-findneighborhoodpoints)


This method finds neighborhood points as in the previous method, but also computes a vector of weights associated with each of those points. 


### function FindNeighborhoodPoints

```cpp
inline virtual PointVectorType FindNeighborhoodPoints(
    const PointType & ,
    int idx,
    std::vector< double > & ,
    std::vector< double > & ,
    double 
) const
```


**Reimplemented by**: [itk::ParticleSurfaceNeighborhood::FindNeighborhoodPoints](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleSurfaceNeighborhood.md#function-findneighborhoodpoints)


This method finds neighborhood points as in the previous method, but also computes a vector of distances associated with each of those points. 


### function FindNeighborhoodPoints

```cpp
inline virtual unsigned int FindNeighborhoodPoints(
    const PointType & ,
    int idx,
    double ,
    PointVectorType & 
) const
```


### function itkSetObjectMacro

```cpp
itkSetObjectMacro(
    Domain ,
    DomainType 
)
```


Set the Domain that this neighborhood will use. The Domain object is important because it defines bounds and distance measures. 


### function itkGetConstObjectMacro

```cpp
itkGetConstObjectMacro(
    Domain ,
    DomainType 
)
```


### function AddPosition

```cpp
inline virtual void AddPosition(
    const PointType & p,
    unsigned int idx,
    int threadId =0
)
```


**Reimplemented by**: [itk::ParticleRegionNeighborhood::AddPosition](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleRegionNeighborhood.md#function-addposition), [itk::ParticleRegionNeighborhood::AddPosition](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleRegionNeighborhood.md#function-addposition)


For efficiency, itkNeighborhoods are not necessarily observers of itkParticleSystem, but have specific methods invoked for various events. AddPosition is called by itkParticleSystem when a particle location is added. SetPosition is called when a particle location is set. RemovePosition is called when a particle location is removed. 


### function SetPosition

```cpp
inline virtual void SetPosition(
    const PointType & p,
    unsigned int idx,
    int threadId =0
)
```


**Reimplemented by**: [itk::ParticleRegionNeighborhood::SetPosition](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleRegionNeighborhood.md#function-setposition), [itk::ParticleRegionNeighborhood::SetPosition](../Classes/classitk_1_1ParticleRegionNeighborhood.md#function-setposition)


### function RemovePosition

```cpp
inline virtual void RemovePosition(
    unsigned int idx,
    int threadId =0
