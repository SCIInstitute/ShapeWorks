# Left Atrium: Shape Model from Segmentations

## What is the Use Case? 


The `left_atrium` use case demonstrates using ShapeWorks tools to perform the following:
- Groom data and build a shape model where shapes are given as binary segmentations
- Showcase both single-scale and multi-scale optimization for particles optimization
Corresponding imaging data (e.g., MRI) is available with this dataset.

## Grooming Steps
This is how the segmentations in the dataset look before grooming.Here it can been seen that the atriums have random centers andn orientations.![This is how the segmentations in the dataset look before grooming.](https://sci.utah.edu/~shapeworks/doc-resources/pngs/left_atrium_pre_groom.png)

The grooming stage entails rigid transformations to align samples for groupwise modeling and analysis. It also changes the origin, voxel size, image size, orientation, etc. of the shape data. Grooming can be done with imaging data (CT/MRI) so that it is carried through each grooming step and with the shapes so that is remains in alignemtn and can be used for subsequent analysis. Here are the grooming steps:

1. [**Isotropic Resampling**](../../workflow/groom.md#resampling-images-and-segmentations): Binary segmentations in `left_atrium/segmentations/` are resampled to have an isotropic voxel spacing.
2. [**Centering**](../../workflow/groom.md#aligning-segmentations): Segmenations are translated to have an origin at (0,0,0).
3. [**Apply Padding**](../../workflow/groom.md#cropping-and-padding-segmentations): Segmentations that touch the image boundary will have an artificial hole at that intersection. Segmentations are padded by adding a user-defined number of voxels along each image direction (rows, cols, and slices) to avoid introducing artificial holes.
4. [**Center-of-Mass Alignment**](../../workflow/groom.md#aligning-segmentations): This translational alignment step is performed before rigidly aligning the samples to a shape reference. This factors out translations to reduce the risk of misalignment and allow for a medoid sample to be automatically selected as the reference for rigid alignment.
5. [**Reference Selection**](../../workflow/groom.md#aligning-segmentations): The reference is selected by first computing the mean (average) distance transform of the segmentations, then selecting the sample closest to that mean (i.e., medoid).
6. [**Rigid Alignment**](../../workflow/groom.md#aligning-segmentations): All of the segmentations are then aligned to the selected reference using rigid alignment, which factors out the rotation and remaining translation. 
7. [**Bounding Box**](../../workflow/groom.md#cropping-and-padding-segmentations): The smallest region which fits all of the samples is found.
8. [**Cropping**](../../workflow/groom.md#cropping-and-padding-segmentations): The segmentations are cropped to the size of the bounding box.
9. [**Distance Transform**](../../workflow/groom.md#converting-segmentations-to-smooth-signed-distance-transforms): Finally, the signed distance transform is computed, and the dataset is now ready for the optimize phase.

Here are the resulting groomed ditsance transforms.The left atriums are now centred and aligned ready to be sent to the optimizer.

[--num_subsample](../use-cases.md#-use_subsample)
[--skip_grooming](../use-cases.md#-skip_grooming)

## Optimization Parameters
The python code for the use case calls the `optimize` command of ShapeWorks which requires the parameters of the optimization to be specified in a python dictionary. Please refer to [Parameter Dictionory in Python](../../workflow/optimize.md#parameter-dictionary-in-python) for more details. 
Below are the default optimization parameters when running this use case.
```python
{
    "number_of_particles" : 512, 
    "use_normals": 0,
    "normal_weight": 10.0,
    "checkpointing_interval" : 200,
    "keep_checkpoints" : 0,
    "iterations_per_split" : 4000,
    "optimization_iterations" : 4000,
    "starting_regularization" : 1000,
    "ending_regularization" : 10,
    "recompute_regularization_interval" : 2,
    "domains_per_shape" : 1,
    "relative_weighting" : 10,
    "initial_relative_weighting" : 0.1,
    "procrustes_interval" : 1,
    "procrustes_scaling" : 1,
    "save_init_splits" : 0,
    "verbosity" : 0,
    "use_shape_statistics_after": 128
}
```
## Analyzing Shape Model
Once the python code runs the optimization, the files are saved in the `Output` folder after which ShapeWorks Studio is launched from the python code to analyze the model.
