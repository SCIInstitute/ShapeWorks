# How to Analyze Your Shape Model?

After ShapeWorks Optimize we have a correspondence model for the population and now we can perform some statistical 
analysis like PCA and visualize these modes of variation. ShapeWorks provides visualization tool named ***ShapeWorksStudio***. 
This platform is based on the VTK library with the following functionality.
* visualizing the particles on shapes at a time with in built surface reconstruction, and can scroll through the dataset.
* Computing the PCA of the correspondence data and allows for animating the variation of shape along a principle component.
* Visualization of the mean shape.
* Exports the eigenvalues and the PCA loadings of each shape in an excel sheet for analysis.
* If there are groups in the data it can visualize group differences.

In order to execute the *ShapeWorksStudio* GUI, it takes in an *xml* parameter file which is generated by the *`ShapeWorksRun`*
in optimization stage and it is called *`analyze.xml`*, includes the path to the input data and corresponding particles.
 The following command executes the GUI.
  
```
ShapeWorksStudio analyze.xml
```
