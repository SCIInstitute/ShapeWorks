![ShapeWorks Cloud Dataset List](../img/cloud/datasets.png)

The dataset list displays the uploaded datasets. Each dataset contains [projects](cloud-project.md), which are where you interact with the data.

## Create Subset

The "Create Subset" option allows you to create a new subset dataset from the selected dataset. Here, you are able to provide a name, description, and keywords. You are also able to select which anatomies and subjects you wish you include in the subset.

## Thumbnail
