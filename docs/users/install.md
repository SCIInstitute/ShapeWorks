## Installing ShapeWorks on Windows

Please make sure that you download the [latest ShapeWorks binary release](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/ShapeWorks/releases/latest), or up-to-date development builds from the master branch for [Windows](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/ShapeWorks/releases/tag/dev-windows). *Please understand that these are in-progress development builds, not official releases.*

To install:

- Download and install the "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019." :

```

```

- Download and install Miniconda for Windows:

```
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
```

- Copy "C:\Program Files\ShapeWorks\Examples" to another location

- Open "Anaconda Prompt"

- CD to "C:\Program Files\ShapeWorks"

- Run:

```
$ conda_installs.bat
```

!!! danger "Running conda_installs.bat"
    If you already have anaconda/miniconda installed, this step may hang.  If this step hangs, please uninstall anaconda/miniconda and re-install it and then run conda_installs.bat.

- CD to your copied Examples\Python location

- To run an example:

```
$ python RunUseCase.py --use_case [insert name of use case here]

```
$ python RunUseCase.py --help
