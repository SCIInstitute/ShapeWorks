/**
 * \class SamplingFunction
 *
 * \brief This function returns an estimate of the gradient of the entropy of a
 * particle distribution with respect to change in position of a specific
 * particle in that distribution.

 *
 * The following description is an excerpt from
 *
 *J Cates, P T Fletcher, M Styner, M Shenton, R Whitaker. Shape Modeling and
 * Analysis with Entropy-Based Particle Systems.  Information Processing in
 * Medical Imaging IPMI 2007, LNCS 4584, pp. 333ï¿½345, 2007.
 *
 *
 * We treat a surface as a subset of \f$\Re^d\f$, where \f$d=2\f$ or \f$d=3\f$
 * depending whether we are processing curves in the plane or surfaces in a
 * volume, refspectively.  The method we describe here deals with smooth,
 * closed manifolds of codimension one, and we will refer to such manifolds as
 * {\em surfaces}.  We sample a surface \f${\cal S} \subset \Re^d\f$ using a
 * discrete set of \f$N\f$ points that are considered random variables \f$Z =
 * (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N)\f$ drawn from a probability density function (PDF),
 * \f$p(X)\f$.  We denote a realization of this PDF with lower case, and thus
 * we have \f$z = (x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_N)\f$, where \f$z \in {\cal S}^N\f$.  The
 * probability of a realization \f$x\f$ is \f$p(X = x)\f$, which we denote
 * simply as \f$p(x)\f$.
 *
 * The amount of information contained in such a random sampling is, in the
 * limit, the differential entropy of the PDF, which is \f$H[X] = -\int_S p(x)
 * \log p(x) dx = -E\{\log p(X)\}\f$, where \f$E\{ \cdot \}\f$ is the
 * expectation. When we have a sufficient number of points sampled from
 * \f$p\f$, we can approximate the expectation by the sample mean, which gives
 * \f$H[X] \approx - (1/N)\sum_{i} \log p(x_i)\f$.  We must also estimate
 * \f$p(x_i)\f$.  Density functions on surfaces can be quite complex, and so we
 * use a nonparametric, Parzen windowing estimation of this density using the
 * particles themselves.  Thus we have
 *\f[
 * p(x_i) \approx \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum^N_{j=1, j \neq i} G(x_i - x_j,
 * \sigma_i),
 * \f]
 * where \f$G(x_i - x_j,
 * \sigma_i)\f$ is a \f$d\f$-dimensional, isotropic Gaussian with standard
 * deviation \f$\sigma_i\f$.  The cost function \f$C\f$, is therefore an
 * approximation of (negative) entropy:
 * \f[
 * -H[X] \approx C(x_1, \dots, x_N) =
 * \sum_{i} \log \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{j \neq i} G(x_i - x_j, \sigma_i).
 * \f]
