ShapeWorks
=====================

<img src="docs/img/home/shapeworks-logo.png" width="300px" align="left" hspace="20">

ShapeWorks is an open-source software that learns population-specific shape parameterization directly from user data. It enables the automated placement of dense corresponding landmarks on a group of shapes given as either binary volumes or surface meshes. Please visit [ShapeWorks website](http://sciinstitute.github.io/ShapeWorks/) for more information. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. [See relevant papers](http://sciinstitute.github.io/ShapeWorks/users/papers).
