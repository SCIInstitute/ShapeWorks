'''
Runs data augmentation and takes the following arguments:
- out_dir = directory to save augmented data and related info
- img_list = list of paths to images of real examples augmentation is based off of
- local_point_list = list of paths to local.particle files associated with examples in img_list
- num_samples = how many samples to generate
- num_dim = number of dimensions to reduce data too when embedding
- aug_type = type of augmentation to run, 1 is for aug based only on particles, 2 bases aug on images and particles
- sampler_type = type of distribution to represent embedded data with for sampling
- processes = number of processes to break image generation between for parallelization
- world_point_list = list of paths to local.particle files (required if different from local)
