# Configures developer environment such that:
# - PATH and PYTHONPATH point to $BUILD_BIN
# - PYTHONPATH points to each module in $SOURCE/Python
#
# Example when build directory is inside source:
#   (shapeworks) ~/code/ShapeWorks$ source ./devenv.sh ./build/bin
#
# After sourcing this, processes in the environment will use executables from
# the given build and import modules from the developer's source (including the
# compiled portion of the Python bindings).
