## ShapeWorks Groom

ShapeWorks needs suitable distance transforms for establishing shape correspondence. Groom stage has a pipeline to 
generate the distance transforms from input images (binary segmentation or mesh).  It consists of image/mesh pre-processing and 
alignment tools.

### Image pre-Processing 

#### Isotropic Resampling
This command line uses an interpolation process to resample anisotropic voxels into isotropic-sized voxels. The command
line tool can be used as follows.

``
ResampleVolumesToIsotropic --inFilename $1 --outFilename $2 --isBinaryImage $3 --isoSpacing $4 --isCenterImageOn $5
``
Here is the list of arguments.

* inFilename: The filename of the input image to be resampled.
* outFilename: The filename of the output resampled image.
* isBinaryImage: A flag to treat the input image as a binary image (specialized resampling pipeline).

 of the first voxel (lower left corner).
* sizeX                    Image size in x-direction (optional, if set to 0, the size is autmatically estimated from the input image).

#### Extract Given Label from Image

A command line tool that extracts/isolates a specific voxel label from a given multi-label volume and outputs the corresponding binary image.

* outFilename: The filename of the output binary image( usually the same os the inFilename).

#### Fast Marching

`` 

* inFilename: The filename of the input image to be processed.
* outFilename: The filename of the output distance transform image.
* isoValue: The level set value that defines the interface between foreground and background.

#### Topology Preserving Smoothing
This tool smooths the distance transforms while preserving the shape’s topology. This command line tool reads the parameters 
from a *xml* file. 

``
TopologyPreservingSmoothing parameterFile.xml
`` 

Here is the list of all parameters in the parameter file.

* inputs: The file names of the input distance transforms to be smoothed.
* dtFiles: The file names of the output smoothed distance transforms.
* outputs: The file names of the output smoothed iso-surface images.
* verbose: (default; 0) Show each intermediate step .

* alpha : (default: 10.5) Smoothing parameter in [I'](#equation/alpha).
* beta : (default: 10.0) Smoothing parameter in [I'](#equation/alpha).

#### Reflect Image
This tool reflects an image. It can be used when you want to align all pairs of anatomies together. For example, if you have left and right femurs and want to align them all, you would first reflect one side or the other so they are all either left or right femurs.

``
ReflectVolumes --inFilename $1 --outFilename $2 --centerFilename $3 --inputDirection $4 
``

* inFilename: The filename of the input image to be reflected.
* outFilename: The filename of the output reflected image.
* centerFilename: The filename where the image center about which reflection occured will be stored.
* inputDirection: Direction along which to reflect.

#### Write Image Information
This tool will write information about an image to text. This can be useful if you have a segmented mesh that corresponds to the image which you would like to turn into a volume with the same parameters for example. It produces three text files: one with the x, y, and z origin, one with the x, y, and z size (or dimensions of the image), and one with the x, y, and z voxel spacing.

``
WriteImageInfoToText --inFilename" $1 --outPrefix $2
``

* inFilename: The filename of the input image.
* outPrefix: The prefix for the output files. Output files will be: prefix_origin.txt, prefix_size.txt, and prefix_spacing.txt.

#### Clip Volume
This tool clips a binary volume using a defined cutting plane. It could be used to remove unwanted variance across samples. For example, if you have various femur segmentations with different shaft lengths you may want to clip these volumes so all the shaft lengths are close to the same.

``
ClipVolume parameterFile.xml
``

Here is the list of all parameters in the parameter file.

* num_shapes: Number of volumes you are clipping.
* inputs: The filenames of binary volumes to clip.
* outputs: The filenames of the output clipped volumes.
* cutting_planes: The planes with which to cut the volumes. Planes are defined by three points (pt1, pt2, and pt3) and the parameter should be formated in the following way: pt1_x pt1_y pt1_z pt2_x pt2_y pt2_z pt3_x pt3_y pt3_z.



### Mesh Pre-Processing

#### Reflect Mesh
This tool reflects a mesh segmentation. It can be used when you want to align all pairs of anatomies together. For example, if you have left and right femurs and want to align them all, you would first reflect one side or the other so they are all either left or right femurs.

``

* outFilename: The filename of the output reflected mesh.

#### Mesh to volume
This tool generates a binary volume and distance transform from a ".ply" mesh. If an image corresponding to the mesh exists, the origin, spacing, and size settings should be the same as this image. This information can be acquired using the WriteImageInfoToText tool.

``
TopologyPreservingSmoothing parameterFile.xml
`` 

Here is the list of all parameters in the parameter file.
* mesh: The file name of the input mesh.
