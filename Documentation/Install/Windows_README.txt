Shapeworks
=====================

The ShapeWorks software is an open-source distribution of a new method
for constructing compact statistical point-based models of ensembles
of similar shapes that does not rely on any specific surface
parameterization. The method requires very little preprocessing or
parameter tuning, and is applicable to a wide range of shape analysis
problems, including nonmanifold surfaces and objects of arbitrary
topology. The proposed correspondence point optimization uses an
entropy-based minimization that balances the simplicity of the model
(compactness) with the accuracy of the surface representations. The
ShapeWorks software includes tools for preprocessing data, computing
point-based shape models, and visualizing the results.

=====================

You have downloaded a binary distribution of ShapeWorks.

To use:

1. Download and install the "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for
Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019." :

https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

2. Download and install Anaconda for Windows:

https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe

3. Copy "C:\Program Files\ShapeWorks\Examples" to another location

4. Open "Anaconda Prompt"

5. CD to "C:\Program Files\ShapeWorks"

6. Run "conda_installs.bat"

7. CD to your copied Examples\Python location

8. Run "python RunUseCase.py --use_case ellipsoid"

Note: If you have installed ShapeWorks in a different location than
"C:\Program Files\ShapeWorks", please add the path to the "bin"
directory as the final argument to RunUseCase.py so that the path will
be set correctly.

Note: Running conda_installs.bat will activate the conda shapeworks environment
into your current anaconda prompt.  For later usage, to activate it, you must only run:

"conda activate shapeworks"
