# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

ShapeWorks uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment).  GitHub Actions will automatically build ShapeWorks pull requests, run automated tests, and build deployable packages (artifacts).

Documentation for GitHub Actions is found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

The YAML files for ShapeWorks are found in the source code repository in the `.github/workflows` folder.
